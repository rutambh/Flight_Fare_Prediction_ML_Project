# Flight Fare Prediction Project

This repository showcases a comprehensive machine learning project designed to predict flight fares. The project demonstrates various data science and machine learning techniques, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately forecasts flight fares using historical flight data. This involves several key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and converting data types.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting valuable features from date and time columns, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Model Training**: Implementing and comparing multiple regression models including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Utilizing cross-validation and other metrics to assess model performance.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the Random Forest model using RandomizedSearchCV.
